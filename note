service mysql start: This command starts the MySQL 
or MariaDB service on the system. It assumes that 
you have MySQL or MariaDB installed as a system service, 
and it's starting that service.



Database Servers and Sockets:

Database servers, like MySQL and MariaDB, use sockets for local connections. When a client application running on the same server wants to communicate with the database server, it can use a Unix domain socket to establish a connection. This is often more efficient than using network sockets because it doesn't involve the overhead of IP routing and network protocols.
Network sockets are used for remote connections to a database server. In this case, the client application specifies the server's IP address and port number to establish a connection over a network.
In summary, sockets are a low-level communication mechanism used for processes to exchange data, and they come in two main flavors: local (Unix domain sockets) and network sockets. Database servers, depending on the type of connection (local or remote), may use either Unix domain sockets for local communication or network sockets for remote communication.

While sockets are a foundational concept in networking and inter-process communication, they don't directly relate to databases themselves but are crucial for enabling client applications to communicate with database servers, whether locally or over a network.
